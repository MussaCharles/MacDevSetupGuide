# MacDevSetupGuide
Steps I follow to setup every new mac for development. 


## 1. Homebrew
- The first this I do is setting up homebrew for it to act as a package manager for most of the apps/CLI tools I use in my day to day development. 
- Note: Even though homebrew require Xcode Command lines tools to be installed first you don't need to manually install them as the command to install homebrew will automatically install Xcode select tools for you if not installed already.
- Installation and other guidelines can be found on the [official homebrew website](https://brew.sh/)
